			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Question: Is the U.S. population aging over time?</strong>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to start with the most comprehensive visualization that I could think of. Population pyramids show a lot of granularity as I could display every age bucket separately</li>
				<li>I thought it might be useful to display each gender separately, maybe to get a better idea of how each gender is aging or not</li>
				<li>I liked that each age bracket was side-by-side for easy comparison</li>
				<li>Population pyramids control for population growth by displaying percentages of the population, not raw population</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Since the ages are lumped into buckets, there would be less visual information to process and viewers get the general idea that there is a higher percent of the population in older age buckets in 2000</li>
				<li>Pie-charts are a widely used and understood method of presenting information</li>
				<li>It is easier to represent the proportions in each bucket relative to the whole in the pie chart</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The age distribution would show granular data for every age bucket but wouldn't include unnecessary granularities like gender for the question we were trying to answer.</li>
				<li>Both lines would be on the same axes so they would be easy to compare</li>
				<li>The shape of the line would effectively communicates the age distribution similar to the population pyramid.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The population pyramid definitely displayed the most detailed information, as it showed the age distributions for each gender separately between the two years.
		However, drawing different bars for both genders added unnecessary information into the visualization and perhpas distracted from the core question we were trying to answer. 
		To mitigate this, I tried simplifying the information into a pie-chart, which is easily digestable. Grouping the age-buckets together decreased the visual noise and got 
		the main point across. However, having two separate charts means that the user has to switch between both charts and comparisons aren't as obvious and easy. Although pie-charts
		make it easier to see how each piece relates to the whole, the complex distribution of the population also gets lost (the pieces of the pie are more difficult to relate to each other).
		With the pie-chart, the sequential nature of the age buckets also gets lost; each piece is treated like a discrete category and the viewer may forget that these buckets exist in a 
		natural sequence. I think the age distribution graph is the most effective for a variety of reasons. I originally wanted to simply sketch the distribution of each year in raw population numbers
		but I switched to percentages after sketching the population pyramids as I thought it would be more effective. I think the lines being on the same axes was extremely effective, because they're the
		easiest to compare out of the three graphs. Like the population pyramid, it communicates the shape of the distribution for each year. However, it doesn't complicate it with the additional variable of gender.
		In the next phase, I definitely want to keep the principle of including detail but removing aspects of the data irrelevant to the question.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>
			<p>
				I decided to keep a structure similar to a population pyramid, as I think the shape clearly communicates age distributions among populations more effectively 
				than pie charts and even line graphs. I removed gender information as it is not directly related to 
				the question the graphic was ultimately trying to answer. I also thought that a format that broke down the composition of 100 people in 1900 and 2000 would 
				be easily digestable and capture more interest than percentages (but would effecively communicate the same information). I also decided to combine the buckets 
				of 5 into buckets of 10 because the that much granularity is not required for the user to grasp that the population was relatively older in 2000 as compared to 1900. 
				I used color to differentiate between 1900 and 2000, and I used shade to differentiate between ages so the graphic is less monotonous and easier to grasp.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I think the final graphic was quite effective at communicating the idea of an aging population (especially with the iconography). The sketches definitely informed my final decisions;
		while I originally thought that displaying as much of the data as I could would be ideal, through sketching I realized that when gender information was incorporated, it was unclear
		what question the infographic was actually trying to answer. I kept the population pyramid shape of the infographic as I liked how my population pyramid and line graph visually displayed 
		and contrasted age distributions. Through sketching, I realized I could combine buckets of ages to convey the same information (as buckets of 5 do not drastically improve the quality of the
		graphic from buckets of 10, and may in fact make the graphic harder to decipher). Combining into buckets of 10 also meant that people did not have to be represented fractionally (<1%) in as many 
		age buckets.
